          %p
            Are you diabetic or ‘pre-diabetic? Does diabetes run in your family?  Let someone who has traveled that road help you.  Our diabetes management and prevention program has proven results.  By combining a proper regimen of appropriate exercise with a rational, manageable nutrition program we can help you to control your diabetes rather than let it control you.  The right combination of cardio-, resistance and functional exercise will build muscle mass, reduce body fat and strengthen overall lifestyle performance.  Three easy sessions a week planned according to your busy schedule.
